# Capstone-Project
Sentimental Analysis of Amazon Alexa products
INTRODUCTION:
The problem statement for this project is given as “How to improve in amazon alexa with Natural Language Processing “.
This dataset consists of almost 3000 Amazon customer reviews on different amazon alexa products.
There are columns in the dataset which explains about details like the star ratings, date of reviews posted, variant and feedback about the
different alexa products. Different products which are referred are like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks and many more. This project
is basically implemented to predict the feedback on the amazon Alexa products and do sentimental analysis to improve the Alexa products.
Various insights can be discovered from this dataset by visualizing and understanding user’s reviews. Moreover, ratings can also be 
predicted to find out the number of positive reviews as well as number of negative reviews. 
The dataset for this problem includes 5 columns and 3150 rows in total. The five columns or five attributes in the dataset are – (1) rating, 
(2) date, (3) variation (4) verified_reviews (5) feedback. 
Following steps are performed-
1. Data Visualization
2. Feature Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
   1) STOPWORDS Removal
   2) STEMMER
   3) Punctuation removal
   4) TFIDF
4. Sentimental Analysis using graph
5. Models for predicting the outcome variable-
   1) Random Forest
   2) Gradient Boosting Tree
   3) Decision Tree Classifier
6. Evaluation Metrics-
   1) Accuracy
   2) Confusion Matrix
   3) Probability
   4) Area Under Curve(AUC)
7. Results show that Value for AUC gives that GBT classifier performed better then random forest tree classifier in predicting the values
   and that model is more optimal to use for predicting feedback for each user. 
   For an instance, from this data we could easily interpreted that it looked like there needs to be a lot of improvement in the audio system 
   from both hardware and software perspective especially improvement in the audio output systems.
